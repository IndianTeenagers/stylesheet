# Stylesheet for r/IndianTeenagers Old Reddit

Some of us minimalism fans still stick to Old Reddit, and r/IndianTeenagers didn't have a custom CSS for Old Reddit. Since I became a moderator here I thought it would be a good idea to take up the initiave on working on the Old Reddit Stylesheet. 

## Repository Structure
- `src/main.css` - The subreddit stylesheet code.
- `sidebar.md` - Markdown for the subreddit sidebar, not a part of the CSS stylesheet.
- `images/` - The folder for storing images for the stylesheet.

## Instructions
- Copy and paste the code from `src/main.css` here in [stylesheet settings](https://old.reddit.com/r/IndianTeenagers/about/stylesheet/).
- Upload the required images from the `images` folder, refer to the code for which names to use while uploading images.
- Press save.

## How did it look before this?

- Before:
Before I implemented custom stylesheet, it looked kinda weird.
